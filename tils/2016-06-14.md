# TIL: Debugging Node with colours

Today I learnt that while debugging a node application using `console.log()` in the terminal I can pass an argument to format the styles.

```javascript
console.log('\x1b[31m%s\x1b[0m', 'Hello, world');  // red
```

Let's break down what `'\x1b[31m%s\x1b[0m'` means though;

- `\x1b[31m` - This is an ANSI style, the `\x1b[` is made up of an escape sequence, `\x1b`, and a `[`. Together this is called a Control Sequence Introducer (or Initiator). The CSI is followed by `31` which is the actual styling (in this case red text) this is then followed by `m` which is the ANSI code terminator.
- `%s` - This is simple the placeholder for where the text being logged.
- `\x1b[0m` - Like the one at the beginning but it uses the styling code `0` which will reset the styling. If you don't have this everything in your terminal will be styled until something else overwrites it.

## Useful Styles

Code       | Style
---------- | ---------------------------
`31`       | Red Text
`32`       | Green Text
`33`       | Yellow Text
`34`       | Blue Text
`35`       | Magenta Text
`36`       | Cyan Text
`41`..`46` | [color as above] Background

A full list can be found [here]()

## Note

```js
// The `%s` is only a placeholder for the first argument.
// In this example only the string `'Metadata'` will be red, the actual
// `metadata` will still be logged in the default color.
console.log('\x1b[31m%s\x1b[0m', 'Metadata', metadata);

// If you want the color both/multiple arguments you'll have to add another `%s`
// after that (with a space between each or they'll bunch up).
console.log('\x1b[31m%s %s\x1b[0m', 'Metadata', metadata);
```
