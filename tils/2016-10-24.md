## TIL: `count++` and `++count` is different...

Today I learnt that `count++` and `++count` is different.

`count++` will return the current value of count and then increment it.
```js
let count = 0;
count++ // => 0
count   // => 1
```

Whereas `++count` increments the count and then returns its value
```js
let count = 0;
count++ // => 1
count   // => 1
```
