## TIL: You can just request HEAD from an API

In addition to `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` & `DELETE` methods, some APIs will allow you to make a `HEAD` request, this allows you to receive just the Header and not the body.

This can be useful if you are making a request to check the existence of a file like an image from an API but you don't actually want to receive the file.
