## TIL: Blocks

Someone used block scoping in a PR I was reviewing and I didn't know what it was used for...

Using Curly Braces you can create a block which has it's own scope. As far as I understand it was completely useless in Javascript until ES2016 introduced `let` and `const`. `let` has block scoping so:

```js
let x = 10

{
  // x is available here
  x // => 10

  // and can be reassigned
  x = 'tomato'
}

x // => 'tomato'

```
```js

let y = 'potato'

{
  // We can use `let` within this block however the
  // reassignment will only be in scope for this block
  // (I would imagine this is bad practice)
  let y = 45

  y // => 45
}

// Our original `y` variable is still available in this scope
y // => 'potato'
```

The way [this was being used](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-front-page/pull/1144/files#r84289557) in the PR was mainly to stop leaking variable scope but also to increase readability (I disagree personally) by keeping a small group of statements that were just doing one thing separately visually separate.
